# Login-system---PHP-MySQL
Login system without cookies using PHP and MySQL

This repository contains a login system using PHP to authenticate users to a MySQL database. This database has only 2 users (DAVID, 1234 and Mary, 4321). Once logged in, a welcome page is displayed with the possibility of linking to 2 different pages. They all have a logout system. 

It is required to have a server (XAMMP, etc).
